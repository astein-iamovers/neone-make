# NEONE Server Setup - Forward Notifications to a Make Webhook

The neone-make repository is an alternative configuration allowing you to forward notifications to the automation platform Make (or Zappier), using Make webhooks. These platforms give you the flexibility to process the notification and implement workflows according to your needs.

Go to the main [neone repository](https://github.com/astein-iamovers/neone) if you have your own NOTIFICATION_ENDPOINT (ensure it has the "/notification" suffix).

The [neone-flask repository](https://github.com/astein-iamovers/neone-flask) provides an alternative configuration using a customizable Flask application to receive and process notifications directly. This option is ideal for companies that prefer to manage notifications within their own infrastructure, offering full control and flexibility over notification handling.

## Notifications

ONE Record requires each server to implement a notifications endpoint to receive notifications from other ONE Record servers. While the NEONE server includes a notifications endpoint, processing and integrating notifications into your systems is beyond the scope of ONE Record. This flexibility allows companies to define their own rules and workflows for handling notifications.

The NEONE Server stores notifications as objects and allows you to forward them to your own custom NOTIFICATION_ENDPOINT. In the current version, NEONE expects the notification endpoint to end with /notifications.

Make or Zappier's webhooks do not contain this "/notifications" suffix so a workaround is required. The following setup uses a proxy service, Caddy, to receive these notifications and forward them to the Make Webhook.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
- Make Webhook created.
- Have your variables handy to update the .env file

## Step by step guide

1) Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/astein-iamovers/neone-make.git
   ```
2) Switch to the directory neone
   ```bash
   cd neone-make
   ```
3) If you have Mac or Linux, please reset folder permissions to allow cross-container dependencies.
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 ./
   ```
4) Modify your .env file with the nano editor.
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```
   Paste your variables
   - BASE_1R_HOST: the URL of your ONE Record Server
   - CLIENT_ID: given by IAM
   - CLIENT_SECRET: given by IAM
   - AUDIENCE: given by IAM

5) Modify the Caddyfile adding your Make webhook details
   ```bash
   nano Caddyfile
   ```
   Replace the placeholders MAKE_HOST and MAKE_PATH with your webhook details.
   Note that the URL needs to be split. If your webhook is https://hook.us2.make.com/zbugts03uc1i2ouvsx1ksnwzv07cql1x, then the MAKE_HOST is https://hook.us2.make.com and the MAKE_PATH is /zbugts03uc1i2ouvsx1ksnwzv07cql1x (include the initial hash)
   
   To save an exit: ctrl+x then Y then Enter
6) Start all services with [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
   ```bash
   sudo docker compose up -d
   ```
7) Wait until all containers are up and running:
   ```bash
   [+] Running 6/6
    ✔ Network docker-compose_default            Created
    ✔ Container docker-compose-graph-db-1       Healthy
    ✔ Container docker-compose-graph-db-setup-1 Started
    ✔ Container docker-compose-ne-one-server-1  Healthy
    ✔ Container neone-ne-one-play-1             Started
    ✔ Container neone-ne-one-view-1             Started
    ✔ Container caddy-1                         Started
        
    
   ```
8) Try to access the ONE Record Server by http://{BASE_1R_HOST}:8080 using your favorite browser.
   You should see a HTTP Error 401, because you did not authenticate yet. But this confirms that the ONE Record Server is up and running.
